## 1. Get the files
You can edit my models in onshape, or download STEP files and import into the CAD software of your choice.
- If you are familiar with onshape, you can head to the document [here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/9e06891469d51d2e78eeebf4/w/8d63af5475c88c87d3523b0d/e/6fecc675f45ce1d0c777016a). The part studios are organized into folders, and most of the relevant ones are in *home > the framework > the locks*.
- Otherwise, download STEP files from the links below:
  - <a href="../step/locks/lock_basic.step" download>Basic lock</a>    
  - <a href="../step/locks/lock_hollow_.step" download>Hollow lock</a>
  - <a href="../step/locks/lock_mounting.step" download>Mounting lock</a>
  - <a href="../step/locks/lock_clocking_hollow.step" download>Clocking lock (hollow)</a>
  - <a href="../step/locks/lock_subtraction.step" download>Subtraction- basic lock</a>
  - <a href="../step/locks/lock_subtraction_clocking.step" download>Subtraction- clocking lock</a>
## 2. Design  
There are three main design patterns: basic, lock-and-plate, and clocking.
- #### Basic
  For most small attachments, the easiest solution is to build the attachment directly on to a basic lock. A great example is the [small parts bin]().
