<h2>About Gyre</h2>
<p>
    I created Gyre because I like to look at my walls.
    Silly, I know, but I really don't like pegboard-style systems that cover large amounts of surface area.
    They just seem, well, inelegant. <br />
    I set out to design a system that only takes up wall space where it's needed, and leaves the rest open.
    Along the way, I discovered other perks, like the unique aesthetic and the super-satisfying 'click' that the
    parts make when they snap into place. <br/> Being relatively new to CAD modeling, the <a href="./design.md">design process</a> was a wonderful
    learning experience and a ton of fun. I look foreword to building up the catalog of attachments and seeing what
    you all add to it as well. I hope you enjoy Gyre as much as I do. <br/><br />
